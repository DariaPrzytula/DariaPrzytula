<h3 align="center">Hi, My name is Daria. <br> I am begginer Data Scientist from Poland</h3>



### ðŸš€ About me

Personal development has always been an essential part of my journey. <br>

My engineering experience at the Institute of Fluid-Flow Machinery allowed me to build, improve, and patent new devices, fostering my creativity and problem-solving skills. Wanting to expand my expertise even further, I decided to explore a new field that would complement my technical background.<br>

At the beginning of 2021, I discovered Python and quickly realized its potential in engineering and data analysis. This new skill became a valuable addition to my experience, allowing me to approach problem-solving from a fresh perspective and integrate programming into my engineering work.
